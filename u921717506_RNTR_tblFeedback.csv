1,PeterD,"I love the website and the concept.  It is exactly what the Burlington rental community has needed.  Honest, unbiased, reviews of rental properties in the area by tenants who lived there.  Awesome!",
2,PeterD,Fantastic website.  This idea is exactly what renters need.  Unbiased real world feedback from past renters.  Awesome concept!  So glad you created this site.,
3,PeterD,"Tried to edit/update one of my reviews, but after making some changes there was no way to save the changes.  So I lost all of my updates.",
4,PeterD,"I would love to provide you with some feedback, however my eyeballs are burning from this bright purple color piercing my retinas.  I will apply eye drops tomorrow and try again.  Great website!  I am looking forward to using it once I get some new sunglasses.",
5,PeterD,My eyes are still burning!  Like swimming in a chlorine pool with your eyes open,
