        <p>
            Hey everyone,
        </p>
        <p>
            My name is Noel, and I'm a Junior Computer Science and Information Systems major at UVM and the creator of RNTR.
            I came up with the idea for RNTR after going through the painful process of trying to find an apartment in Burlington, VT.
            I noticed the need for a single platform where people can come to get honest reviews about apartments they want to rent
            and landlords they're considering signing leases with. People looking for apartments in Burlington are powerless
            against landlords who can raise the prices to whatever they want because they know they have a captive audience.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted to create a way to increase transparency and hold landlords accountable. With RNTR, you can see what
            problems previous tenants had with the landlord and apartment. You shouldn't have to go through online forums, Facebook groups,
            and word of mouth to get information about a landlord or apartment. It is so easy for landlords to make their
            apartment look nice for the few minutes that people are there to tour it before signing their lease.
            That's why I created this crowd-sourced renters database where people can find all the information they need in one place.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope you join us in increasing renting transparency in Burlington and are able to use the information on RNTR to find your perfect apartment.
        </p>
